# Nervegear
A Discord Rich Presence application that parodies the anime Sword Art Online.

Author: Ten#0010

# THIS IS NOT A GAME
Nervegear will <ins>only give you a nice Discord status</ins>.

If you're expecting a Sword Art Online game, this ain't one.

### Usage
`How do I use Nervegear?`
> You download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/TenDRILLL/Nervegear/releases) tab on this repository, and run it.

`Nervegear isn't showing on my Discord!?!`
> Make sure you have enabled the `Activity Status` from your Discord Settings.
> [Reference](https://i.imgur.com/Vz3vnJI.png)
>
> Also make sure not to have other Applications on that could hijack the Activity.
> 
> *Most games and applications are fine, Nervegear should take priority.*

`Is Nervegear a virus? My antivirus is warning me about it.`
> Antiviruses like to false flag Nervegear as it is not digitally signed.
> 
> I will not be digitally signing Nervegear, as that costs a lot of money.
> 
> You're free to run any Antivirus scanner on it to *calm your nerves*.
>
> I also take no responsibility over an altered version of Nervegear.
> 
>Only download the official version from this repository.
### Contributing

Dependancies:
```
discord-rpc     - Library to connect with a locally running Discord desktop client.
electron        - Library that renders the GUI.
(nexe)          - Library that compiles the executable, not required but is used here.
```

Do note I will not approve any changes that are not "canon" with Nervegear,

including but not limited to `Ordinal Scale` as it couldn't be played with Nervegear.
